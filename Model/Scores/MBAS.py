        Predict anomalies based on individual anomaly scores.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_lenghts : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
            The anomaly scores or path lengths computed for each sample.

        threshold : float, default=0.6
            The cutoff value used to classify samples.
            If the score > threshold â†’ sample is labeled as anomaly (1),
            otherwise it is considered normal (0).

        Returns
        -------
        y_pred : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
            Binary prediction array where 1 indicates anomaly and 0 indicates normal.
